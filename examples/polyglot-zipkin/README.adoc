= Example Polyglot Application Instrumented with Zipkin Libraries

Example applications demonstrating polyglot environment instrumented with several Zipkin instrumentation libraries.

Used instrumentations:

* Java (JAX-RS): https://github.com/openzipkin/brave[brave]
* Java Dropwizard (JAX-RS): https://github.com/smoketurner/dropwizard-zipkin[dropwizard-zipkin] uses brave
* Apache Cassandra: https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-zipkin-tracing[cassandra-zipkin-tracing] uses brave
* JavaScript (express, cujoJS): https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-js[zipkin-js]
* Ruby (rack): https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-ruby[zipkin-ruby]
* Python (Pyramid): https://github.com/Yelp/pyramid_zipkin[pyramid_zipkin]
* Python (Bravado): https://github.com/Yelp/swagger_zipkin[swagger_zipkin]

[[architecture]]
image::architecture.png[Architecture]

Architecture diagram shows dependencies between services. The whole environment
can be executed with docker-compose. Some of the services can be used in standalone mode, however some
of the endpoints might not work as they are calling external services. Feel free to experiment and add new endpoints or
services.

== Run
Before running ensure that containers from previous run were removed.

[source,shell]
----
$ export KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER=172.17.0.1
$ export TRACING_SERVER=172.17.0.1
$ export TRACING_PORT=8080

$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up

$ docker-compose down -> stop and remove all containers (when you finish)
----


Open other terminal and run tracing server (Hawkular APM or Zipkin). It has to be started after docker-compose (it
depends on Kafka broker).
[source,shell]
----
$ export KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER=172.17.0.1
$ /bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -Djboss.http.port=8080
----

* `TRACING_SERVER` - address of tracing server. It cannot be localhost,
                     therefore bind tracing server to `0.0.0.0` address or `172.17.0.1` (docker0 interface).
* `TRACING_PORT` - port of the tracing server. Hawkular APM 8080 or zipkin 9411.
* `KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER` - enables kafka consumer in APM and Zipkin server. It should be an address of the machine with docker engine.

== Example requests
[source,shell]
----
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3001/nodejs/hello'
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3000/dropwizard/hello'
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3003/wildfly-swarm/hello'
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3002/roda/hello'
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3004/pyramid/hello'
-> hello calls

$ curl -ivX POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://localhost:3001/nodejs/createUser' -d '{"name": "jdoe"}'
-> multi service call for user creation
$ curl -ivX POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://localhost:3000/dropwizard/users' -d '{"name": "jdoe"}'
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3000/dropwizard/users'
-> create and get users in dropwizard (using MySQL)
$ curl -ivX POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://localhost:3003/wildfly-swarm/users' -d '{"name": "jdoe"}'
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3003/wildfly-swarm/users'
-> create and get users in wildfly-swarm (using Cassandra)
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3000/dropwizard/asyncTwoOutgoingCalls'
-> asynchronous call
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3000/dropwizard/A'
-> chaining requests within one service
$ curl -ivX GET 'http://localhost:3004/pyramid/loop'
-> chaining requests within one service

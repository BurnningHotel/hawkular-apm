/**
 * Binary annotations are tags applied to a Span to give it context. For
 * example, a binary annotation of "http.url" could be the path to a resource in a
 * RPC call.
 *
 * Binary annotations of type STRING are always queryable, though more a
 * historical implementation detail than a structural concern.
 *
 * Binary annotations can repeat, and vary on the host. Similar to Annotation,
 * the host indicates who logged the event. This allows you to tell the
 * difference between the client and server side of the same key. For example,
 * the key "http.url" might be different on the client and server side due to
 * rewriting, like "/api/v1/myresource" vs "/myresource. Via the host field,
 * you can see the different points of view, which often help in debugging.

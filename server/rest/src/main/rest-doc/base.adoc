== Overview

=== Media Type

The API uses *JSON* to communicate with clients.

You _should_ add the following accept header to your requests:

----
Accept: application/json
----

When you send JSON data with a `POST` or `PUT` request, you _must_ add the following content type header:

----
Content-Type: application/json
----

=== Tenant Header

Hawkular APM is a multi-tenant system. Your requests to tenant-dependent resources must include
a tenant header:

----
Hawkular-Tenant: my-tenant
----

=== Timestamps

The API understands all timestamps as milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

=== Response codes

Resources in the API follow response codes conventions, listed below.

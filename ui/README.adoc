= Hawkular APM UI

== Developing the UI

The UI is built and distributed as a war using maven. However using this process to test out UI changes is time consuming.
Therefore, to perform development on the UI you will need start the APM server from the
*dist/target/hawkular-apm-dist-_<version>_* folder, and then perform the following command from *ui/target/gulp-build*
folder:

----
gulp watch-server
----

When any changes are made to the UI code, the _gulp_ command will rebuild the Javascript and CSS files and copy them
into the appropriate location within the running APM server. To see these changes simply refresh the UI in the browser.

== Client

The client folder contains components to be used instrument the client environment. Therefore we need to minimise dependencies to reduce the footprint on the client. As a result, the following applies:

* Use java.util.logging instead of JBoss logger (although currently there is an issue using JUL in wildfly that impacts startup of the JBoss logging module)

* Use the ServiceResolver (based on the Java ServiceLoader mechanism) to locate service implementations, rather than CDI

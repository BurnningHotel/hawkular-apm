= Client

The client folder contains components to be used instrument the client environment. Therefore we need to
minimise dependencies to reduce the footprint on the client. As a result, the following applies:

* Use java.util.logging instead of JBoss logger (although currently there is an issue using JUL in Wildfly
that impacts startup of the JBoss logging module, so use `org.hawkular.apm.api.logging.Logger` which is signature
compatible for a subset of the methods, and can therefore be replaced by JUL when the Wildfly issue is resolved).

* Use the `org.hawkular.apm.api.services.ServiceResolver` (based on the Java ServiceLoader mechanism) to
locate service implementations, rather than CDI.

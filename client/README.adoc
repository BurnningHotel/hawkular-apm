== Client

The client folder contains components to be used instrument the client environment. Therefore we need to
minimise dependencies to reduce the footprint on the client. As a result, the following applies:

* Use java.util.logging instead of JBoss logger (although currently there is an issue using JUL in wildfly
that impacts startup of the JBoss logging module, so use _org.hawkular.btm.api.client.Logger_ which is signature
compatible for a subset of the methods, and can therefore be replaced by JUL when the Wildfly issue is resolved).

* Use the _org.hawkular.btm.api.util.ServiceResolver_ (based on the Java ServiceLoader mechanism) to
locate service implementations, rather than CDI

= Hawkular-APM OpenTracing support
:source-language: java

The OpenTracing support provided by this module is currently at the prototype stage. It has been
provided to help evaluate and progress the work being done by the OpenTracing group.

However the APIs being developed by OpenTracing are not yet stable, and the implementations
they provide are subject to change.

Any feedback on using our OpenTracing provider to instrument your applications will be appreciated.

Any comments regarding the usability of the API should be directed to the http://opentracing.io/
project (although we would also be interested in hearing your thoughts).
